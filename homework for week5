Model checking is a family technique of automated verification of dynamic systems. It is part of algorithmically verificat
e if a given model, the system itself or a system abstraction match a requirement.

We can distinguate two aspects of model checking :

Demonstrate a certain class property or logical belongs a certain class complexity

Search efficient algorithms on interesting cases, to implement them and to apply them to real problems.

Model checking exhaustively analyze system evolution on its execution (running time). By example, to demonstrate the no 
running time errors we could test the no error statement accessible on the system.
