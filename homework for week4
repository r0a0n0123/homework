Control-flow behavioural testing applies to almost all software and is effective for most software. It is a 
fundamentaltechnique. Its applicability is mostly to relatively small programs or segments of larger programs.

Control Flow Testing is a form of White-box testing. It is a testing technique which bases its tests on the structure
of the code. "Coverage" refers to the amount of the program which has been tested. Normally, 100% coverage is the 
target or criterion. 100% coverage is essential in safety critical systems.

Statement Coverage 

Statement coverage is the percentage of the total number of reachable statements in the code that are executed (and
therefore tested). Anything less than 100% statement coverage means that not all lines of code have been executed.

Branch Coverage 

Branches occur when there are conditional statements. The start of any program is also viewed as a branch. This means 
that, by definition, every program has at least one branch which is to be tested. 100% branch coverage means that every
arc (flow) in the Control Flow Diagram (CFG) is traversed.

Path Coverage 

A path is a series of arcs (flows) from a start node to a specified end node. To obtain 100% path coverage, every 
unique path must be tested. Path coverage is more thorough than branch coverage. It can be hard / impossible to obtain 
100% path coverage in some cases because the number of paths can be near to infinite when looping is involved.
